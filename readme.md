# Peregrine - a bleeding fast HTTP server
This is a HTTP server written in pure Zig with no dependencies other than Zig's standard library.

The main goal of this project is to provide a HTTP server, with the following priorities (in order of prevalence):
- Reliability
- Performance
- Simplicity

## Getting started
```zig
const std = @import("std");
const peregrine = @import("peregrine");

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    const srv = try peregrine.Server.init(.{
        .allocator = allocator,
        .listen_port = 3000,
        .on_request = on_request,
        // .listen_ip defaults to 0.0.0.0
        // .worker_count defaults to CPU core count
    });
    std.debug.print("listening on 0.0.0.0:3000\n", .{});
    try srv.start(); // This blocks if there is no error
}

fn on_request(req: *peregrine.Request, resp: *peregrine.Response) void {
    std.debug.print("got request: {any} {s}\n", .{ req.method, req.getPath() });
    resp.setBody("Kawww\n") catch {};
    resp.headers.append(.{ .key = "Content-Length", .value = "6" }) catch {};
}
```

As it stands, the configuration is minimal, with sensible defaults. Simply provide a request handler function.

The server will shutdown gracefully if an interrupt signal is received. Alternatively, you can call `srv.shutdown()` yourself.

## No magic behind the scenes
For example, you need to set the Content-Length header yourself. Regardless of whether it's an ArrayList or a HashMap, checking if it was set already by the user would incur a cost (albeit small). Again, this library is designed to be reliable, performant, and simple.

## I need your feedback
I started this project as a way to learn Zig. As such, some of it will be garbage. I would value any feedback.

## This is no framework
This is not a framework for building web applications. This is purely a HTTP server designed from the ground up to be stable and performant. There are no built-in features such as routing or authentication.

If you want a more substantial HTTP library, I suggest that you look at [Zap][https://github.com/zigzap/zap], built on [Facil.io][http://facil.io]. Facil.io is an excellent battle-tested library written in C.

## Benchmarks
I will add some graphs later. Currently, this (unfinished) server is around 3-5% faster than Zap/Facil.io for static GET requests.

## To do
- Query params
- Redirects
- HTTP/1.1 (keep-alive)
- Better task scheduling
- WebSockets
- HTTP/2
